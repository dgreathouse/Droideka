This is the FRC 2023 Robot code for Team 8517

## Drivetrain
The drivetrain is made up of 3 SwerveX units that are placed in the corner of a layout that looks like a home plate. The front of the robot is the flat end or the cloesest pitcher. 
## Chassis
The Chassis holds the SwerveX modules and arm that is used to pick up and drop off the Codes and Cubes.
## Arm
The Arm on this robot mimics a human arm anatomy. A Sholder motor rotates the entire arm. An elbow motor rotates the forearm and the intake. The inake motor rotates the intake.
